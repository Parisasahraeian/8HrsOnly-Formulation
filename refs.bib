	N2 = {Suboptimal fitness peaks are generally recognized as causing evolutionary stasis. Here, we show that these constraints can be overcome in an adaptive manner by reconstructing mutational trajectories for a transcription factor and its DNA binding site in variable environments. Cross-environmental tradeoffs, typically associated with evolutionary limitations, are an essential enabling component of this evolutionary mechanism. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing environmental dependencies when studying genetic interactions and provide the clearest indication so far that environmental variability can accelerate evolution hampered by stasis in constant conditions. Given that environmental variations and tradeoffs are ubiquitous, this evolutionary mechanism may be relevant to a wide range of genetically constrained phenotypes and major evolutionary transitions.Epistatic interactions can frustrate and shape evolutionary change. Indeed, phenotypes may fail to evolve when essential mutations are only accessible through positive selection if they are fixed simultaneously. How environmental variability affects such constraints is poorly understood. Here, we studied genetic constraints in fixed and fluctuating environments using the Escherichia coli lac operon as a model system for genotype--environment interactions. We found that, in different fixed environments, all trajectories that were reconstructed by applying point mutations within the transcription factor--operator interface became trapped at suboptima, where no additional improvements were possible. Paradoxically, repeated switching between these same environments allows unconstrained adaptation by continuous improvements. This evolutionary mode is explained by pervasive cross-environmental tradeoffs that reposition the peaks in such a way that trapped genotypes can repeatedly climb ascending slopes and hence, escape adaptive stasis. Using a Markov approach, we developed a mathematical framework to quantify the landscape-crossing rates and show that this ratchet-like adaptive mechanism is robust in a wide spectrum of fluctuating environments. Overall, this study shows that genetic constraints can be overcome by environmental change and that cross-environmental tradeoffs do not necessarily impede but also, can facilitate adaptive evolution. Because tradeoffs and environmental variability are ubiquitous in nature, we speculate this evolutionary mode to be of general relevance.},

@article{Pal2017Evolution-of-co,
	Abstract = {A central challenge in evolutionary biology concerns the mechanisms by which complex adaptations arise. Such adaptations depend on the fixation of multiple, highly specific mutations, where intermediate stages of evolution seemingly provide little or no benefit. It is generally assumed that the establishment of complex adaptations is very slow in nature, as evolution of such traits demands special population genetic or environmental circumstances. However, blueprints of complex adaptations in molecular systems are pervasive, indicating that they can readily evolve. We discuss the prospects and limitations of non-adaptive scenarios, which assume numerous neutral or deleterious steps in the evolution of complex adaptations. Next, we examine how complex adaptations can evolve by natural selection in a changing environment. Finally, we argue that molecular `springboards'such as phenotypic heterogeneity and promiscuous interactions facilitate this process by providing access to new adaptive paths.},

	Abstract = {The binding of transcription regulators to cis-regulatory sequences is a key step through which all cells regulate expression of their genes. Due to gains and losses of cis-regulatory sequences and changes in the transcription regulators themselves, the binding connections between regulators and their target genes rapidly change over evolutionary time and constitute a major source of biological novelty. This review covers recent work, carried out in a wide range of species, that addresses the overall extent of these evolutionary changes, their consequences, and some of the molecular mechanisms that lie behind them.},

@article{Chen2012PICARA-an-analy,
	Abstract = {PICARA is an analytical pipeline designed to systematically summarize observed SNP/trait associations identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and to identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of complex trait variation. The pipeline provides probabilistic inference about a priori candidate genes using integrated information derived from genome-wide association signals, gene homology, and curated gene sets embedded in pathway descriptions. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of PICARA using data for flowering time variation in maize - a key trait for geographical and seasonal adaption of plants. Among 406 curated flowering time-related genes from Arabidopsis, we identify 61 orthologs in maize that are significantly enriched for GWAS SNP signals, including key regulators such as FT (Flowering Locus T) and GI (GIGANTEA), and genes centered in the Arabidopsis circadian pathway, including TOC1 (Timing of CAB Expression 1) and LHY (Late Elongated Hypocotyl). In addition, we discover a regulatory feature that is characteristic of these a priori flowering time candidates in maize. This new probabilistic analytical pipeline helps researchers infer the functional significance of candidate genes associated with complex traits and helps guide future experiments by providing statistical support for gene candidates based on the integration of heterogeneous biological information.},

	Abstract = {{Understanding telomere length maintenance mechanisms is central in cancer biology as their dysregulation is one of the hallmarks for immortalization of cancer cells. Important for this well-balanced control is the transcriptional regulation of the telomerase genes. We integrated Mixed Integer Linear Programming models into a comparative machine learning based approach to identify regulatory interactions that best explain the discrepancy of telomerase transcript levels in yeast mutants with deleted regulators showing aberrant telomere length, when compared to mutants with normal telomere length. We uncover novel regulators of telomerase expression, several of which affect histone levels or modifications. In particular, our results point to the transcription factors Sum1, Hst1 and Srb2 as being important for the regulation of EST1 transcription, and we validated the effect of Sum1 experimentally. We compiled our machine learning method leading to a user friendly package for R which can straightforwardly be applied to similar problems integrating gene regulator binding information and expression profiles of samples of e.g. different phenotypes, diseases or treatments.}},

In some sports leagues, such as Major League Baseball in the United States, umpires travel throughout the league's territory; they do not have a ``home base.'' For such leagues, balancing the need to minimize umpire travel and the objective that an umpire should not handle the games of a particular team too frequently is important. We have used our approach, which is based on network optimization and simulated annealing, to successfully schedule Major League Baseball umpires. To develop this approach, we created the traveling umpire problem, which includes the major umpire scheduling issues and also provides a test bed for alternative techniques. },

	Abstract = {{Motivation: A number of omic technologies such as transcriptional profiling, proteomics, literature searches, genetic association, etc. help in the identification of sets of important genes. A subset of these genes may act in a coordinated manner, possibly because they are part of the same biological pathway. Interpreting such gene lists and relating them to pathways is a challenging task. Databases of biological relationships between thousands of mammalian genes can help in deciphering omics data. The relationships between genes can be assembled into a biological network with each protein as a node and each relationship as an edge between two proteins (or nodes). This network may then be searched for subnetworks consisting largely of interesting genes from the omics experiment. The subset of genes in the subnetwork along with the web of relationships between them helps to decipher the underlying pathways. Finding such subnetworks that maximally include all proteins from the query set but few others is the focus for this paper.Results: We present a heuristic algorithm and a scoring function that work well both on simulated data and on data from known pathways. The scoring function is an extension of a previous study for a single biological experiment. We use a simple set of heuristics that provide a more efficient solution than the simulated annealing method. We find that our method works on reasonably complex curated networks containing ∼9000 biological entities (genes and metabolites), and ∼30 000 biological relationships. We also show that our method can pick up a pathway signal from a query list including a moderate number of genes unrelated to the pathway. In addition, we quantify the sensitivity and specificity of the technique.Contact:dilip\_rajagopalan@gsk.com}},

@article{Ideker2002,
	Abstract = {{Motivation: In model organisms such as yeast, large
databases of  protein--protein and protein-DNA interactions have
become an extremely  important resource for the study of protein
function, evolution, and gene  regulatory dynamics. In this
paper we demonstrate that by integrating these  interactions
with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to 
generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms
governing the  observed changes in gene expression. To perform
this integration  systematically and at large scale, we
introduce an approach for screening a  molecular interaction
network to identify active subnetworks, i.e.,  connected 
regions of the network that show significant changes in
expression over  particular subsets of conditions. The method we
present here combines a  rigorous statistical measure for
scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm  for identifying
subnetworks with high score.Results: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362
interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 
protein--protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public
databases.  In the case of the small network, we identified five
significant subnetworks  that covered 41 out of 77 (53\\%) of all
significant changes in expression.  Both network analyses returned
several top-scoring subnetworks with good  correspondence to known
regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These  results demonstrate
how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to  uncover signalling
and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative  fashion.Availability: The methods presented in this paper are

Of particular interest has been the identification of active subnetworks by detecting regions enriched with differential expression. In contrast, however, very little effort has been made toward the application of comparable methods to other types of high-throughput data.Results: Here, we propose a new method based on co-clustering that is specifically designed for the exploratory analysis of large-scale, RNAi-based functional screens. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a genome-scale dataset aimed at identifying host factors of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition to recovering known cellular modules relevant to HCV infection, the results enabled us to identify new candidates and formulate biological hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for a number of them. For example, our analysis indicated that HCV, similar to other enveloped viruses, exploits elements within the endosomal pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate assembly and release. This echoed a number of recent studies which showed that the ESCRT-III complex is essential to productive infection.Contact:gonzalez@bio.ifi.lmu.deSupplementary Information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

on this function, we compute a joint clustering of genes and

metabolic networks. We define a graph distance function on such

clustering and an associated statistical measure is computed to
arrive at a reasonable number of clusters. Our method is
validated using expression data of the yeast diauxic shift. The
resulting clusters are easily interpretable in terms of the

Personalized medicine is expected to benefit from combining genomic information with regular monitoring of physiological states by multiple high-throughput methods. Here, we present an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity.},

plausible assumptions, our algorithm is polynomial and is
guaranteed to find the most significant biclusters.
We tested our method on a collection of yeast expression profiles

high specificity in assigning function to genes
based on their biclusters, and we are able to annotate in this way
196 uncharacterized yeast genes. We also demonstrate how the
biclusters lead to detecting new concrete biological associations.
In cancer data we are able to detect and relate finer tissue types

@article{PONTES2015163,
	Abstract = {Biclustering has become a popular technique for the study of gene expression data, especially for discovering functionally related gene sets under different subsets of experimental conditions. Most of biclustering approaches use a measure or cost function that determines the quality of biclusters. In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

@article{Fischetti2017Thinning,
	Abstract = {The Steiner tree problem is a challenging NP-hard problem. Many hard instances of this problem are publicly available, that are still unsolved by state-of-the-art branch-and-cut codes. A typical strategy to attack these instances is to enrich the polyhedral description of the problem, and/or to implement more and more sophisticated separation procedures and branching strategies. In this paper we investigate the opposite viewpoint, and try to make the solution method as simple as possible while working on the modeling side. Our working hypothesis is that the extreme hardness of some classes of instances mainly comes from over-modeling, and that some instances can become quite easy to solve when a simpler model is considered. In other words, we aim at ``thinning out''the usual models for the sake of getting a more agile framework. In particular, we focus on a model that only involves node variables, which is rather appealing for the ``uniform''cases where all edges have the same cost. In our computational study, we first show that this new model allows one to quickly produce very good (sometimes proven optimal) solutions for notoriously hard instances from the literature. In some cases, our approach takes just few seconds to prove optimality for instances never solved (even after days of computation) by the standard methods. Moreover, we report improved solutions for several SteinLib instances, including the (in)famous hypercube ones. We also demonstrate how to build a unified solver on top of the new node-based model and the previous state-of-the-art model (defined in the space of arc and node variables). The solver relies on local branching, initialization heuristics, preprocessing and local search procedures. A filtering mechanism is applied to automatically select the best algorithmic ingredients for each instance individually. The presented solver is the winner of the DIMACS Challenge on Steiner trees in most of the considered categories.},

	Abstract = {{Motivation: With the exponential growth of expression and protein--protein interaction (PPI) data, the frontier of research in systems biology shifts more and more to the integrated analysis of these large datasets. Of particular interest is the identification of functional modules in PPI networks, sharing common cellular function beyond the scope of classical pathways, by means of detecting differentially expressed regions in PPI networks. This requires on the one hand an adequate scoring of the nodes in the network to be identified and on the other hand the availability of an effective algorithm to find the maximally scoring network regions. Various heuristic approaches have been proposed in the literature.Results: Here we present the first exact solution for this problem, which is based on integer-linear programming and its connection to the well-known prize-collecting Steiner tree problem from Operations Research. Despite the NP-hardness of the underlying combinatorial problem, our method typically computes provably optimal subnetworks in large PPI networks in a few minutes. An essential ingredient of our approach is a scoring function defined on network nodes. We propose a new additive score with two desirable properties: (i) it is scalable by a statistically interpretable parameter and (ii) it allows a smooth integration of data from various sources.We apply our method to a well-established lymphoma microarray dataset in combination with associated survival data and the large interaction network of HPRD to identify functional modules by computing optimal-scoring subnetworks. In particular, we find a functional interaction module associated with proliferation over-expressed in the aggressive ABC subtype as well as modules derived from non-malignant by-stander cells.Availability: Our software is available freely for non-commercial purposes at http://www.planet-lisa.net.Contact:tobias.mueller@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de}},

	Abstract = {Integer linear programming (ILP) is a powerful and versatile technique for framing and solving hard optimization problems of many types. In the last several years, ILP has become widely used in computational biology, although predominantly by computationally and mathematically trained researchers, such as Bernard Moret. In an effort to reach a broader set of researchers, this chapter begins with an introduction to ILP, illustrated by the phenomena of cliques and independent sets in biological graphs. Then, the focus shifts to new research results on the use of ILP to solve traveling salesman problems, using compact ILP formulations. Such formulations have been largely declared useless in the optimization literature. However, in this chapter, I argue that the correct compact formulation can be very effective for problems of the size and structure that arise in computational biology. These empirical results, and some additional arguments, then bring into question the relevance of the concept of strength of an ILP formulation as a predictor of the speed that it will beInteger Linear Programming (ILP)Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)Moret, BernardInteger Linear Programming (ILP)strength of formulationsolved.},

	Abstract = {Lagrangean relaxation produces bounds on the optimal value of (mixed) integer programming problems. These bounds, together with integer feasible solution values, provide intervals bracketing the optimal value of the original problem. When the residual gap, i.e., the relative size of the interval, is too large for the approximations to be deemed satisfactory, it is desirable to `strengthen' the Lagrangean bounds. One possible strengthening technique consists of identifying cuts which are violated by the current Lagrangean solution, and dualizing them. Unfortunately not every valid inequality that is currently violated will improve the Lagrangean relaxation bound when dualized. This paper investigates what makes a violated cut `efficient' in improving bounds. It also provides examples of efficient cuts for several (mixed) integer programming problems.},

@article{Glover1988Layering-strate,
	Abstract = {The strategy of subdividing optimization problems into layers by splitting variables into multiple copies has proved useful as a method for inducing exploitable structure in a variety of applications, particularly those involving embedded pure and generalized networks. A framework is proposed in this paper which leads to new relaxation and restriction methods for linear and integer programming based on our extension of this strategy. This framework underscores the use of constructions that lead to stronger relaxations and more flexible strategies than previous applications. Our results establish the equivalence of all layered Lagrangeans formed by parameterizing the equal value requirement of copied variables for different choices of the principal layers. It is further shown that these Lagrangeans dominate traditional Lagrangeans based on incorporating non-principal layers into the objective function. In addition a means for exploiting the layered Lagrangeans is provided by generating subgradients based on a simple averaging calculation. Finally, we show how this new layering strategy can be augmented by an integrated relaxation/restriction procedure, and indicate variations that can be employed to particular advantage in a parallel processing environment. Preliminary computational results on fifteen real world zero-one personnel assignment problems, comparing two layering approaches with five procedures previously found best for those problems, are encouraging. One of the layering strategies tested dominated all non-layering procedures in terms of both quality and solution time.},

It discusses schemes that can potentially improve the Lagrangean relaxation bound, and describes several applications of Lagrangean relaxation, which demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, and permit either the computation of strong bounds on the optimal value of the MIP problem, or the use of a Lagrangean heuristic, possibly followed by an iterative improvement heuristic.

@article{BuchananSalemi2020parsimonious,
	Abstract = {In the analysis of networks, one often searches for tightly knit clusters. One property of a ``good''cluster is a small diameter (say, bounded by k), which leads to the concept of a k-club. In this paper, we propose new path-like and cut-like integer programming formulations for detecting these low-diameter subgraphs. They simplify, generalize, and/or dominate several previously existing formulations. Our best-performing formulation uses only node variables (quite unlike previous formulations) and imposes the diameter-at-most-k constraints via an exponentially large class of cut-like inequalities. A relatively simple implementation of the cut-like formulation easily outperforms previous approaches, solving dozens of instances of the maximum k-club problem in a second or two that would take hours by other formulations. Moreover, the cut-like formulation is more general in the sense that it applies even when distances are not measured in terms of hops. While we consider only the k-club problem in this paper, the proposed techniques may also be useful in other applications where compact solutions are key (e.g., political districting and wildlife reserve design).},

Just a few years ago, MIP was viewed as a temptingly powerful modeling paradigm that would consistently disappoint in practice. In constrast, in the last few years MIP has become a vital capability that powers a wide range of applications in a variety of application domains. The shift can clearly be seen in the views of its practitioners, past and present. At one extreme, in the past year we have personally interacted with several OR practitioners who have not had direct exposure to modern MIP technology in several years. Their near-universal reaction to the claim that MIP models of useful size and complexity can now be solved is disbelief. Convincing them of the practicality of MIP modeling can require multiple, corroborating witnesses. At the other extreme, the expectations of users with recent experience can be quite surprising for those who have worked in the eld for a while. A sophisticated MIP modeler recently expressed disappointment when models with millions of constraints and hundreds of thousands of binary variables could not be solved to optimality overnight. He had to console himself with solutions with 5% optimality gaps. The technology has clearly come a long way.},

@article{Huson2007MEGAN-analysis-,
	Abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random "shotgun" approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25--50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

@article{Namiki2012metavelvet,
	Abstract = {{ An important step in `metagenomics' analysis is the assembly of multiple genomes from mixed sequence reads of multiple species in a microbial community. Most conventional pipelines use a single-genome assembler with carefully optimized parameters. A limitation of a single-genome assembler for de novo metagenome assembly is that sequences of highly abundant species are likely misidentified as repeats in a single genome, resulting in a number of small fragmented scaffolds. We extended a single-genome assembler for short reads, known as `Velvet', to metagenome assembly, which we called `MetaVelvet', for mixed short reads of multiple species. Our fundamental concept was to first decompose a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs, and second, to build scaffolds based on each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph as an isolate species genome. We made use of two features, the coverage (abundance) difference and graph connectivity, for the decomposition of the de Bruijn graph. For simulated datasets, MetaVelvet succeeded in generating significantly higher N50 scores than any single-genome assemblers. MetaVelvet also reconstructed relatively low-coverage genome sequences as scaffolds. On real datasets of human gut microbial read data, MetaVelvet produced longer scaffolds and increased the number of predicted genes. }},

	Abstract = {Abstract Plant phenology is known to depend on many different environmental variables, but soil microbial communities have rarely been acknowledged as possible drivers of flowering time. Here, we tested separately the effects of four naturally occurring soil microbiomes and their constituent soil chemistries on flowering phenology and reproductive fitness of Boechera stricta, a wild relative of Arabidopsis. Flowering time was sensitive to both microbes and the abiotic properties of different soils; varying soil microbiota also altered patterns of selection on flowering time. Thus, soil microbes potentially contribute to phenotypic plasticity of flowering time and to differential selection observed between habitats. We also describe a method to dissect the microbiome into single axes of variation that can help identify candidate organisms whose abundance in soil correlates with flowering time. This approach is broadly applicable to search for microbial community members that alter biological characteristics of interest.},

In some cases, contemporary or {\textquotedblleft}rapid{\textquotedblright} evolution can ameliorate the effects of global change. However, the direction and magnitude of evolutionary responses may be contingent upon interactions with other community members that also are experiencing novel environmental conditions. Here, we examine plant adaptation to drought stress in a multigeneration experiment that manipulated aboveground{\textendash}belowground feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities. Although drought stress reduced plant growth and accelerated plant phenologies, surprisingly, plant evolutionary responses to drought were relatively weak. In contrast, plant fitness in both drought and nondrought environments was linked strongly to the rapid responses of soil microbial community structure to moisture manipulations. Specifically, plants were most fit when their contemporary environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) matched the historical environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) of their associated microbial community. Together, our findings suggest that, when faced with environmental change, plants may not be limited to {\textquotedblleft}adapt or migrate{\textquotedblright} strategies; instead, they also may benefit from association with interacting species, especially diverse soil microbial communities, that respond rapidly to environmental change.},

For most disease-suppressive soils, the microbes and mechanisms involved in pathogen control are unknown. By coupling PhyloChip-based metagenomics of the rhizosphere microbiome with culture-dependent functional analyses, we identified key bacterial taxa and genes involved in suppression of a fungal root pathogen. More than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species were detected, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria consistently associated with disease suppression. Members of the γ-Proteobacteria were shown to have disease-suppressive activity governed by nonribosomal peptide synthetases.

	Abstract = {{Despite often being conceptualized as a thin layer of soil around roots, the rhizosphere is actually a dynamic system of interacting processes. Hiltner originally defined the rhizosphere as the soil influenced by plant roots. However, soil physicists, chemists, microbiologists, and plant physiologists have studied the rhizosphere independently, and therefore conceptualized the rhizosphere in different ways and using contrasting terminology. Rather than research-specific conceptions of the rhizosphere, the authors propose a holistic rhizosphere encapsulating the following components: microbial community gradients, macroorganisms, mucigel, volumes of soil structure modification, and depletion or accumulation zones of nutrients, water, root exudates, volatiles, and gases. These rhizosphere components are the result of dynamic processes and understanding the integration of these processes will be necessary for future contributions to rhizosphere science based upon interdisciplinary collaborations. In this review, current knowledge of the rhizosphere is synthesized using this holistic perspective with a focus on integrating traditionally separated rhizosphere studies. The temporal dynamics of rhizosphere activities will also be considered, from annual fine root turnover to diurnal fluctuations of water and nutrient uptake. The latest empirical and computational methods are discussed in the context of rhizosphere integration. Clarification of rhizosphere semantics, a holistic model of the rhizosphere, examples of integration of rhizosphere studies across disciplines, and review of the latest rhizosphere methods will empower rhizosphere scientists from different disciplines to engage in the interdisciplinary collaborations needed to break new ground in truly understanding the rhizosphere and to apply this knowledge for practical guidance.}},

	Abstract = {A major challenge facing agriculture in the 21st century is the need to increase the productivity of cultivated land while reducing the environmentally harmful consequences of mineral fertilization. The microorganisms thriving in association and interacting with plant roots, the plant microbiota, represent a potential resource of plant probiotic function, capable of conjugating crop productivity with sustainable management in agroecosystems. However, a limited knowledge of the organismal interactions occurring at the root--soil interface is currently hampering the development and use of beneficial plant--microbiota interactions in agriculture. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the recruitment cues of the plant microbiota and the molecular basis of nutrient turnover in the rhizosphere will be required to move toward efficient and sustainable crop nutrition. In this chapter, we will discuss recent insights into plant--microbiota interactions at the root--soil interface, illustrate the processes driving mineral dynamics in soil, and propose experimental avenues to further integrate the metabolic potential of the plant microbiota into crop management and breeding strategies for sustainable agricultural production.},

	Abstract = {Abstract All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms; often the combined genetic information of the diverse microbiota exceeds that of the host. How the genetic wealth of the microbiota affects all aspects of the holobiont's (host plus all of its associated microorganisms) fitness (adaptation, survival, development, growth and reproduction) and evolution is reviewed, using selected coral, insect, squid, plant, and human/mouse published experimental results. The data are discussed within the framework of the hologenome theory of evolution, which demonstrates that changes in environmental parameters, for example, diet, can cause rapid changes in the diverse microbiota, which not only can benefit the holobiont in the short term but also can be transmitted to offspring and lead to long lasting cooperations. As acquired characteristics (microbes) are heritable, consideration of the holobiont as a unit of selection in evolution leads to neo-Lamarckian principles within a Darwinian framework. The potential application of these principles can be seen in the growing fields of prebiotics and probiotics. Birth Defects Research (Part C) 93:56--66, 2011. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Root-associated microbiomes vary by soil and host genotype, but the contribution of these factors to community structure and metabolic potential has not been fully addressed. Here we characterize root microbial communities of two disparate agricultural crops grown in the same natural soil in a controlled and replicated experimental system. Metagenomic (genetic potential) analysis identifies a core set of functional genes associated with root colonization in both plant hosts, and metatranscriptomic (functional expression) analysis revealed that most genes enriched in the root zones are expressed. Root colonization requires multiple functional capabilities, and these capabilities are enriched at the community level. Differences between the root-associated microbial communities from different plants are observed at the genus or species level, and are related to root-zone environmental factors.},

A multitude of biotic and abiotic factors are assumed to influence the structural and functional diversity of microbial communities in the rhizosphere. In this review, recent studies on the influence of the two factors, plant species and soil type, on rhizosphere-associated microbial communities are discussed. Root exudates and the response of microorganisms to the latter as well as to root morphology were shown to shape rhizosphere microbial communities. All studies revealed that soil is the main reservoir for rhizosphere microorganisms. Many secrets of microbial life in the rhizosphere were recently uncovered due to the enormous progress in molecular and microscopic tools. Physiological and molecular data on the factors that drive selection processes in the rhizosphere are presented here. Furthermore, implications for agriculture, nature conservation and biotechnology will also be discussed.}},

Plants can actively recruit members of the soil microbial community for positive feedbacks, but the underlying mechanisms and plant traits that drive microbiome assembly and functions are largely unknown. Domestication of plant species has substantially contributed to human civilization, but also caused a strong decrease in the genetic diversity of modern crop cultivars that may have affected the ability of plants to establish beneficial associations with rhizosphere microbes. Here, we review how plants shape the rhizosphere microbiome and how domestication may have impacted rhizosphere microbiome assembly and functions via habitat expansion and via changes in crop management practices, root exudation, root architecture, and plant litter quality. We also propose a ``back to the roots''framework that comprises the exploration of the microbiome of indigenous plants and their native habitats for the identification of plant and microbial traits with the ultimate goal to reinstate beneficial associations that may have been undermined during plant domestication.},

@article{Sukumaran2015Genome-Wide-Ass,
	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that progress in genetic yield potential is associated with adaptation to agronomic planting density, though its genetic basis has not been addressed before. In the current study, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) association mapping initiative (WAMI) panel of 287 elite lines was assessed for the effects of plant density on grain yield (YLD), 1000-kernel weight (TKW), and grain number (GNO) in yield plots consisting of four evenly spaced rows. The YLD and GNO of inner (high plant density) rows compared with outer rows (low plant density) indicated a consistent pattern: genotypes that performed best under intense competition (inner rows) responded less to reduced competition (outer rows) while being generally the best performers on aggregate (inner plus outer rows). However, TKW was not affected by plant density. To identify the genetic loci, an adaptation to density index (ADi) was computed as the scaled difference in trait values between inner and outer rows. Results on biplot analysis indicated that ADi was correlated with YLD in high-yielding environments, suggesting that it is a component of high yield potential. Genotyping of the WAMI panel was done through 90K Illumina Bead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Association mapping employed using 18,104 SNP markers for ADi identified a major locus in chromosome 3B at 71 cM that explained 11.4{\%} variation in ADi for YLD and GNO. Functional marker for ADi will enable identification of the trait in early generations---not otherwise possible in spaced plants typical of pedigree breeding approach---and to select parents for hybrid development.},

In this study, EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level.

	Abstract = {Plant biosecurity requires rapid identification of pathogenic organisms. While there are many pathogen-specific diagnostic assays, the ability to test for large numbers of pathogens simultaneously is lacking. Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows one to detect all organisms within a given sample, but has computational limitations during assembly and similarity searching of sequence data which extend the time needed to make a diagnostic decision. To minimize the amount of bioinformatic processing time needed, unique pathogen-specific sequences (termed e-probes) were designed to be used in searches of unassembled, non-quality checked, sequence data. E-probes have been designed and tested for several selected phytopathogens, including an RNA virus, a DNA virus, bacteria, fungi, and an oomycete, illustrating the ability to detect several diverse plant pathogens. E-probes of 80 or more nucleotides in length provided satisfactory levels of precision (75%). The number of e-probes designed for each pathogen varied with the genome size of the pathogen. To give confidence to diagnostic calls, a statistical method of determining the presence of a given pathogen was developed, in which target e-probe signals (detection signal) are compared to signals generated by a decoy set of e-probes (background signal). The E-probe Diagnostic Nucleic acid Analysis (EDNA) process provides the framework for a new sequence-based detection system that eliminates the need for assembly of NGS data.},

	Abstract = {The human microbiome has emerged as a major player in regulating human health and disease. Translational studies of the microbiome have the potential to indicate clinical applications such as fecal transplants and probiotics. However, one major issue is accurate identification of microbes constituting the microbiota. Studies of the microbiome have frequently utilized sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. We present a comparative study of an alternative approach using whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). In the present study, we analyzed the human fecal microbiome compiling a total of 194.1 × 106 reads from a single sample using multiple sequencing methods and platforms. Specifically, after establishing the reproducibility of our methods with extensive multiplexing, we compared: 1) The 16S rRNA amplicon versus the WGS method, 2) the Illumina HiSeq versus MiSeq platforms, 3) the analysis of reads versus de novo assembled contigs, and 4) the effect of shorter versus longer reads. Our study demonstrates that whole genome shotgun sequencing has multiple advantages compared with the 16S amplicon method including enhanced detection of bacterial species, increased detection of diversity and increased prediction of genes. In addition, increased length, either due to longer reads or the assembly of contigs, improved the accuracy of species detection.},

This complex plant-associated microbial community, also referred to as the second genome of the plant, is crucial for plant health. Recent advances in plant--microbe interactions research revealed that plants are able to shape their rhizosphere microbiome, as evidenced by the fact that different plant species host specific microbial communities when grown on the same soil. In this review, we discuss evidence that upon pathogen or insect attack, plants are able to recruit protective microorganisms, and enhance microbial activity to suppress pathogens in the rhizosphere.

@article{Shen2012root,
	Abstract = {{Root and rhizosphere research has been conducted for many decades, but the underlying strategy of root/rhizosphere processes and management in intensive cropping systems remain largely to be determined. Improved grain production to meet the food demand of an increasing population has been highly dependent on chemical fertilizer input based on the traditionally assumed notion of `high input, high output', which results in overuse of fertilizers but ignores the biological potential of roots or rhizosphere for efficient mobilization and acquisition of soil nutrients. Root exploration in soil nutrient resources and root-induced rhizosphere processes plays an important role in controlling nutrient transformation, efficient nutrient acquisition and use, and thus crop productivity. The efficiency of root/rhizosphere in terms of improved nutrient mobilization, acquisition, and use can be fully exploited by: (1) manipulating root growth (i.e. root development and size, root system architecture, and distribution); (2) regulating rhizosphere processes (i.e. rhizosphere acidification, organic anion and acid phosphatase exudation, localized application of nutrients, rhizosphere interactions, and use of efficient crop genotypes); and (3) optimizing root zone management to synchronize root growth and soil nutrient supply with demand of nutrients in cropping systems. Experiments have shown that root/rhizosphere management is an effective approach to increase both nutrient use efficiency and crop productivity for sustainable crop production. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the principles of root/rhizosphere management and provide an overview of some successful case studies on how to exploit the biological potential of root system and rhizosphere processes to improve crop productivity and nutrient use efficiency.}},

The most influential might be the organisms comprising the soil microbial community of the rhizosphere, which is the soil surrounding the roots of plants where complex interactions occur between the roots, soil, and microorganisms. Root exudates act as substrates and signaling molecules for microbes creating a complex and interwoven relationship between plants and the microbiome. While individual microorganisms such as endophytes, symbionts, pathogens, and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are increasingly featured in the literature, the larger community of soil microorganisms, or soil microbiome, may have more far-reaching effects. Each microorganism functions in coordination with the overall soil microbiome to influence plant health and crop productivity. Increasing evidence indicates that plants can shape the soil microbiome through the secretion of root exudates. The molecular communication fluctuates according to the plant development stage, proximity to neighboring species, management techniques, and many other factors.

@article{Gopal2016Microbiome,
	Abstract = {``No plant is an island too{\ldots}''Plants, though sessile, have developed a unique strategy to counter biotic and abiotic stresses by symbiotically co-evolving with microorganisms and tapping into their genome for this purpose. Soil is the bank of microbial diversity from which a plant selectively sources its microbiome to suit its needs. Besides soil, seeds, which carry the genetic blueprint of plants during trans-generational propagation, are home to diverse microbiota that acts as the principal source of microbial inoculum in crop cultivation. Overall, a plant is ensconced both on the outside and inside with a diverse assemblage of microbiota. Together, the plant genome and the genes of the microbiota that the plant harbors in different plant tissues, i.e., the `plant microbiome,' form the holobiome which is now considered as unit of selection: `the holobiont.' The `plant microbiome' not only helps plants to remain fit but also offers critical genetic variability, hitherto, not employed in the breeding strategy by plant breeders, who traditionally have exploited the genetic variability of the host for developing high yielding or disease tolerant or drought resistant varieties. This fresh knowledge of the microbiome, particularly of the rhizosphere, offering genetic variability to plants, opens up new horizons for breeding that could usher in cultivation of next-generation crops depending less on inorganic inputs, resistant to insect pest and diseases and resilient to climatic perturbations. We surmise, from ever increasing evidences, that plants and their microbial symbionts need to be co-propagated as life-long partners in future strategies for plant breeding. In this perspective, we propose bottom--up approach to co-propagate the co-evolved, the plant along with the target microbiome, through -- (i) reciprocal soil transplantation method, or (ii) artificial ecosystem selection method of synthetic microbiome inocula, or (iii) by exploration of microRNA transfer method -- for realizing this next-generation plant breeding approach. Our aim, thus, is to bring closer the information accrued through the advanced nucleotide sequencing and bioinformatics in conjunction with conventional culture-dependent isolation method for practical application in plant breeding and overall agriculture.},

	Abstract = {The rhizosphere is active and dynamic in which newly generated carbon, derived from root exudates, and ancient carbon, in soil organic matter (SOM), are available for microbial growth. Stable isotope probing (SIP) was used to determine bacterial communities assimilating each carbon source in the rhizosphere of four plant species. Wheat, maize, rape and barrel clover (Medicago truncatula) were grown separately in the same soil under 13CO2 (99{\%} of atom 13C) and DNA extracted from rhizosphere soil was fractionated by isopycnic centrifugation. Bacteria-assimilating root exudates were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 13C-DNA and root DNA, whereas those assimilating SOM were identified from 12C-DNA. Plant species root exudates significantly shaped rhizosphere bacterial community structure. Bacteria related to Sphingobacteriales and Myxococcus assimilated root exudates in colonizing roots of all four plants, whwereas bacteria related to Sphingomonadales utilized both carbon sources, and were identified in light, heavy and root compartment DNA. Sphingomonadales were specific to monocotyledons, whereas bacteria related to Enterobacter and Rhizobiales colonized all compartments of all four plants, used both fresh and ancient carbon and were considered as generalists. There was also evidence for an indirect important impact of root exudates, through stimulation of SOM assimilation by a diverse bacterial community.},

	Abstract = {Plant--microbe interactions in the rhizosphere have important roles in biogeochemical cycling, and maintenance of plant health and productivity, yet remain poorly understood. Using RNA-based metatranscriptomics, the global active microbiomes were analysed in soil and rhizospheres of wheat, oat, pea and an oat mutant (sad1) deficient in production of anti-fungal avenacins. Rhizosphere microbiomes differed from bulk soil and between plant species. Pea (a legume) had a much stronger effect on the rhizosphere than wheat and oat (cereals), resulting in a dramatically different rhizosphere community. The relative abundance of eukaryotes in the oat and pea rhizospheres was more than fivefold higher than in the wheat rhizosphere or bulk soil. Nematodes and bacterivorous protozoa were enriched in all rhizospheres, whereas the pea rhizosphere was highly enriched for fungi. Metabolic capabilities for rhizosphere colonisation were selected, including cellulose degradation (cereals), H2 oxidation (pea) and methylotrophy (all plants). Avenacins had little effect on the prokaryotic community of oat, but the eukaryotic community was strongly altered in the sad1 mutant, suggesting that avenacins have a broader role than protecting from fungal pathogens. Profiling microbial communities with metatranscriptomics allows comparison of relative abundance, from multiple samples, across all domains of life, without polymerase chain reaction bias. This revealed profound differences in the rhizosphere microbiome, particularly at the kingdom level between plants.},

We confirm that soil type is the primary determinant of root-associated bacterial community composition, but also observe a significant correlation with plant phylogeny. A total of 47 bacterial genera are associated with roots relative to bulk soil microbial communities, including well-recognized plant-associated genera such as Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, and Burkholderia, and major uncharacterized lineages such as WPS-2, Ellin329, and FW68. We suggest that these taxa collectively constitute an evolutionarily conserved core root microbiome at this site.

The constituents of the microbiota---bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes---have been shown to interact with one another and with the host immune system in ways that influence the development of disease. We review these interactions and suggest that a holistic approach to studying the microbiota that goes beyond characterization of community composition and encompasses dynamic interactions between all components of the microbiota and host tissue over time will be crucial for building predictive models for diagnosis and treatment of diseases linked to imbalances in our microbiota.},

Indeed, plants harbor a wide diversity of microorganisms both inside and outside their tissues, in the endosphere and ectosphere, respectively. These microorganisms, which mostly belong to Bacteria and Fungi, are involved in major functions such as plant nutrition and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Hence, the microbiota impact plant growth and survival, two key components of fitness. Plant fitness is therefore a consequence of the plant per se and its microbiota, which collectively form a holobiont. Complementary to the reductionist perception of evolutionary pressures acting on plant or symbiotic compartments, the plant holobiont concept requires a novel perception of evolution. The interlinkages between the plant holobiont components are explored here in the light of current ecological and evolutionary theories. Microbiome complexity and the rules of microbiotic community assemblage are not yet fully understood. It is suggested that the plant can modulate its microbiota to dynamically adjust to its environment. To better understand the level of plant dependence on the microbiotic components, the core microbiota need to be determined at different hierarchical scales of ecology while pan-microbiome analyses would improve characterization of the functions displayed.},

	Abstract = {The Elizabethkingia are a genetically diverse genus of emerging pathogens that exhibit multidrug resistance to a range of common antibiotics. Two representative species, Elizabethkingia bruuniana and E. meningoseptica, were phenotypically tested to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for five antibiotics. Ultra-long read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and subsequent de novo assembly produced complete, gapless circular genomes for each strain. Alignment based annotation with Prokka identified 5,480 features in E. bruuniana and 5,203 features in E. meningoseptica, where none of these identified genes or gene combinations corresponded to observed phenotypic resistance values. Pan-genomic analysis, performed with an additional 19 Elizabethkingia strains, identified a core-genome size of 2,658,537 bp, 32 uniquely identifiable intrinsic chromosomal antibiotic resistance core-genes and 77 antibiotic resistance pan-genes. Using core-SNPs and pan-genes in combination with six machine learning (ML) algorithms, binary classification of clindamycin and vancomycin resistance achieved f1 scores of 0.94 and 0.84, respectively. Performance on the more challenging multiclass problem for fusidic acid, rifampin and ciprofloxacin resulted in f1 scores of 0.70, 0.75, and 0.54, respectively. By producing two sets of quality biological predictors, pan-genome genes and core-genome SNPs, from long-read sequence data and applying an ensemble of ML techniques, our results demonstrated that accurate phenotypic inference, at multiple AMR resolutions, can be achieved.},

	Abstract = {Disruptive innovations in long-range, cost-effective direct template nucleic acid sequencing are transforming clinical and diagnostic medicine. A multidrug resistant strain and a pan-susceptible strain of Mannheimia haemolytica, isolated from pneumonic bovine lung samples, were sequenced at 146× and 111× coverage, respectively with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. De novo assembly produced a complete genome for the non-resistant strain and a nearly complete assembly for the drug resistant strain. Functional annotation using RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology), CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) and ResFinder databases identified genes conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics including β-lactams, tetracyclines, lincosamides, phenicols, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and macrolides. Resistance phenotypes of the M. haemolytica strains were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotics. Sequencing with a highly portable MinION device corresponded to MIC assays with most of the antimicrobial resistant determinants being identified with as few as 5437 reads, except for the genes responsible for resistance to Fluoroquinolones. The resulting quality assemblies and AMR gene annotation highlight the efficiency of ultra-long read, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a valuable tool in diagnostic veterinary medicine.},

	Abstract = {Core Ideas Prediction performance for winter wheat grain yield and end-use quality traits. Prediction accuracies evaluated by cross-validations are significantly overestimated. Nonparametric algorithms outperform the parametric alternatives in cross-year predictions. Strategically designing training population improves response to selection. Response to selection varies across growing seasons and environments. Considering the practicality of applying genomic selection (GS) in the line development stage of a hard red winter (HRW) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety development program (VDP), the effectiveness of GS was evaluated by prediction accuracy and by the response to selection across field seasons that demonstrated challenges for crop improvement under significant climate variability. Important breeding targets for wheat improvement in the southern Great Plains of the United States, including grain yield, kernel weight, wheat protein content, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sedimentation volume as a rapid test for predicting bread-making quality, were used to estimate the effectiveness of GS across harvest years from 2014 (drought) to 2016 (normal). In general, nonparametric algorithms reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and random forest (RF) produced higher accuracies in both same-year cross-validations (CVs) and cross-year predictions for the purpose of line selection. Further, the stability of GS performance was greatest for SDS sedimentation volume but least for wheat protein content. To ensure long-term genetic gain, our study on selection response suggested that across this sample of environmental variability, and though there are cases where phenotypic selection (PS) might be still preferred, training conducted under drought or in suboptimal conditions could provide an encouraging prediction outcome when selection decisions were made in normal conditions. However, it is not advisable to use training information collected from a normal season to predict trait performance under drought conditions. Finally, the superiority of response to selection was most evident if the training population (TP) can be optimized.},

	Abstract = {Centrality is a powerful concept for detecting influential components of a network applicable to various areas such as analysis of social, collaboration, and biological networks. In this study, we employ one of the well-known centrality measures, closeness centrality, to detect a group of pairwise connected members (a highly connected community known as a clique) with the highest accessibility to the entire network. To measure the accessibility of a clique, we use two metrics, the maximum distance and the total distance to the clique from other members of the network. Hence, we are dealing with two variants of the most central clique problem referred to as maximum-distance-closeness-central clique and total-distance-closeness-central clique problems. We study the computational complexity of these two problems and prove that their decision versions are NP-complete. We also propose new mixed 0--1 integer programming formulations and the first combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithms to solve these problems exactly. We show that our algorithmic approaches offer at least 83-fold speed-up on over 96% of benchmark instances in comparison to existing approaches.},

	Abstract = {This is a companion paper to our polyhedral study [1] of the Vertex Separator (VS) Problem. Given an undirected graph G, the VS problem consists in identifying a minimum-weight vertex set whose removal disconnects G, subject to bounds on the size of the resulting components. In this paper, we describe versions of a branch-and-cut algorithm based on the results of that polyhedral study. It uses two families of cuts, symmetric and asymmetric, for which we develop polynomial-time greedy separation routines. A heuristic to generate feasible separators is also used. A computational experiment on several data sets from the literature compares the performance of three versions of our algorithm to that of the commercial MIP solver XPRESS. This experiment throws a sharp light on the role of cut density, known to software developers but never before documented in the literature. It convincingly shows that the practical usefulness of cuts in integer programming depends not only on their strength, but also on their sparsity: everything else being equal, the smaller the cut support, the better. The power of the inequalities proposed here is well illustrated by the computational tests on dense graphs. This is in accordance with the previous observation, since the support of these cuts tends to decrease with graph density.},

	Abstract = {Graph theory provides a language for studying the structure of relations, and it is often used to study interactions over time too. However, it poorly captures the intrinsically temporal and structural nature of interactions, which calls for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time, similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher level objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous links, and extensions to more complex cases.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary To study complex cellular networks, we need to consider their dynamic topologies under many different experimental or physiological conditions. Integrative analysis over large numbers of massive biological networks thus emerges as a new challenge in data mining. Recently, we and others have proposed several algorithms for recurrent pattern mining across many () biological networks (with the main focus on unweighted networks). However, thus far no algorithms have been specifically designed to mine recurrent patterns across a large collection of weighted massive networks. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to identify recurrent heavy subgraphs from many weighted large networks. By applying our method to 130 co-expression networks, we identified an atlas of modules that are highly likely to represent functional modules, transcriptional modules, and protein complexes. Many of these modules would be overlooked with unweighted networks analysis. Furthermore, many of the identified modules constituted signatures of specific phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrated that our results facilitate the study of high-order dynamic coordination in protein complex networks and transcriptional regulatory networks.},

	Abstract = {Dynamics of interactions play an increasingly important role in the analysis of complex networks. A modeling framework to capture this is temporal graphs which consist of a set of vertices (entities in the network) and a set of time-stamped binary interactions between the vertices. We focus on enumerating $\Delta$-cliques, an extension of the concept of cliques to temporal graphs: for a given time period $\Delta$, a $\Delta$-clique in a temporal graph is a set of vertices and a time interval such that all vertices interact with each other at least after every $\Delta$ time steps within the time interval. Viard, Latapy, and Magnien (ASONAM 2015, TCS 2016) proposed a greedy algorithm for enumerating all maximal $\Delta$-cliques in temporal graphs. In contrast to this approach, we adapt the Bron--Kerbosch algorithm---an efficient, recursive backtracking algorithm which enumerates all maximal cliques in static graphs---to the temporal setting. We obtain encouraging results both in theory (concerning worst-case running time analysis based on the parameter ``$\Delta$-slice degeneracy'' of the underlying graph) as well as in practice with experiments on real-world data. The latter culminates in an improvement for most interesting $\Delta$-values concerning running time in comparison with the algorithm of Viard, Latapy, and Magnien.},

	Abstract = {Graph-based modeling has emerged as a powerful abstraction capable of capturing in a single and unified framework many of the relational, spatial, topological, and other characteristics that are present in a variety of datasets and application areas. Computationally efficient algorithms that find patterns corresponding to frequently occurring subgraphs play an important role in developing data mining-driven methodologies for analyzing the graphs resulting from such datasets. This paper presents two algorithms, based on the horizontal and vertical pattern discovery paradigms, that find the connected subgraphs that have a sufficient number of edge-disjoint embeddings in a single large undirected labeled sparse graph. These algorithms use three different methods for determining the number of edge-disjoint embeddings of a subgraph and employ novel algorithms for candidate generation and frequency counting, which allow them to operate on datasets with different characteristics and to quickly prune unpromising subgraphs. Experimental evaluation on real datasets from various domains show that both algorithms achieve good performance, scale well to sparse input graphs with more than 120,000 vertices or 110,000 edges, and significantly outperform previously developed algorithms.},

	Abstract = {{Motivation: The rapid accumulation of biological network data translates into an urgent need for computational methods for graph pattern mining. One important problem is to identify recurrent patterns across multiple networks to discover biological modules. However, existing algorithms for frequent pattern mining become very costly in time and space as the pattern sizes and network numbers increase. Currently, no efficient algorithm is available for mining recurrent patterns across large collections of genome-wide networks.Results: We developed a novel algorithm, CODENSE, to efficiently mine frequent coherent dense subgraphs across large numbers of massive graphs. Compared with previous methods, our approach is scalable in the number and size of the input graphs and adjustable in terms of exact or approximate pattern mining. Applying CODENSE to 39 co-expression networks derived from microarray datasets, we discovered a large number of functionally homogeneous clusters and made functional predictions for 169 uncharacterized yeast genes.Availability:http://zhoulab.usc.edu/CODENSE/Contact:xjzhou@usc.edu}},

	Abstract = {Graphs form a natural model for relationships and interactions between entities, for example, between people in social and cooperation networks, servers in computer networks, or tags and words in documents and tweets. But, which of these relationships or interactions are the most lasting ones? In this paper, we study the following problem: given a set of graph snapshots, which may correspond to the state of an evolving graph at different time instances, identify the set of nodes that are the most densely connected in all snapshots. We call this problem the Best Friends Forever ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}BFF) problem. We provide definitions for density over multiple graph snapshots, that capture different semantics of connectedness over time, and we study the corresponding variants of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}BFFproblem. We then look at the On--Off{\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}BFF({\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsc {\{}O{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textsc {\{}2{\}}{\}}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}O2BFF) problem that relaxes the requirement of nodes being connected in all snapshots, and asks for the densest set of nodes in at least k of a given set of graph snapshots. We show that this problem is NP-complete for all definitions of density, and we propose a set of efficient algorithms. Finally, we present experiments with synthetic and real datasets that show both the efficiency of our algorithms and the usefulness of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}BFFand the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsc {\{}O{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}textsc {\{}2{\}}{\}}{\backslash}text {\{}BFF{\}}{\$}{\$}O2BFFproblems.},

The power domination throttling number of G is the minimum sum of the size of a power dominating set S and the number of timesteps it takes S to color the graph. In this paper, we determine the complexity of power domination throttling and give some tools for computing and bounding the power domination throttling number.

A popular clique relaxation are 2-clubs: instead of asking for subgraphs of diameter one (these are cliques), one asks for subgraphs of diameter at most two (these are 2-clubs). A drawback of the 2-club model is that it produces star-like hub-and-spoke structures as maximum-cardinality solutions. Hence, we study 2-clubs with the additional constraint to be well-connected. More specifically, we investigate the algorithmic complexity for three variants of well-connected 2-clubs, all established in the literature: robust, hereditary, and ``connected'' 2-clubs. Finding these more cohesive 2-clubs is NP-hard; nevertheless, we develop an exact combinatorial algorithm, extensively using efficient data reduction rules. Besides several theoretical insights we provide a number of empirical results based on an engineered implementation of our exact algorithm. In particular, the algorithm significantly outperforms existing algorithms on almost all (sparse) real-world graphs we considered.},

	Abstract = {Given a graph G=(V,E) and a threshold γ ∈ (0, 1], the maximum cardinality quasi-clique problem consists in finding a maximum cardinality subset C* of the vertices in V such that the density of the graph induced in G by C* is greater than or equal to the threshold γ. This problem is NP-hard, since it admits the maximum clique problem as a special case. It has a number of applications in data mining, e.g. in social networks or phone call graphs. In this work, we propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm for solving the maximum cardinality quasi-clique problem. Two alternative decoders are implemented for the biased random-key genetic algorithm and the corresponding algorithm variants are evaluated. Computational results show that the newly proposed approaches improve upon other existing heuristics for this problem in the literature. All input data for the test instances and all detailed numerical results are available from Mendeley.},

This problem has applications in many areas, such as crime detection, prevention of outbreaks of infectious diseases and surveillance of communication networks. We propose an integer linear programming formulation of the problem based on an exponential family of Clique-Interdiction Cuts and we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which these cuts are facet-defining. Our new approach provides a useful tool for analyzing the resilience of (social) networks with respect to clique-interdiction attacks, i.e., the decrease of the size of the maximum clique as a function of an incremental interdiction budget level. On a benchmark set of publicly available instances, including large-scale social networks with up to one hundred thousand vertices and three million edges, we show that most of them can be analyzed and solved to proven optimality within short computing time.},

In addition to standard clique betweenness, which is defined as the proportion of shortest paths between any two graph nodes that pass through the clique, we also consider its optimistic and pessimistic versions, where outside nodes may favor or try to avoid shortest paths passing through the clique, respectively. We discuss the computational complexity issues for these problems and develop linear 0--1 programming formulations for each centrality metric. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the developed formulations on real-life and synthetic networks, and provide some interesting insights based on the obtained results. In particular, our findings indicate that there are considerable variations between the centrality values of large cliques within the same networks. Moreover, the most central cliques in graphs are not necessarily the largest ones.},

In this graph, vertices identify individuals and edges establish the existence of some type of relations between them. In real communities, the possible edges may be active or not for variable periods of time. These so-called temporal networks typically result from an endogenous social dynamics, usually coupled to the process under study taking place in the community. For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual's health status. Importantly, we also show how dynamical networks strongly decrease the average time required to eradicate a disease.},

For each model, we present a rigorous and tractable mathematical framework to efficiently find the optimal distribution of control resources to eliminate the disease.

The evolving network arises from email exchanges. The centrality measures, which are relatively inexpensive to compute, assign rankings to individual nodes based on their ability to broadcast information over the dynamic topology. We compare these with node rankings based on infectiousness that arise when a full stochastic SI simulation is performed over the dynamic network. More precisely, we look at the proportion of the network that a node is able to infect over a fixed time period, and the length of time that it takes for a node to infect half the network. We find that the dynamic centrality measures are an excellent, and inexpensive, proxy for the full simulation-based measures.},

The implied network structure is vital in determining disease dynamics, especially when the average number of connections per individual is small as is the case for many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Here we develop an intuitive mathematical framework to deal with the heterogeneities implicit within contact networks and those that arise because of the infection process. These models are compared with full stochastic simulations and show excellent agreement across a wide range of parameters. We show how such models can be used to estimate parameters of epidemiological importance, and how they can be extended to examine the effectiveness of various control strategies, in particular screening programs and contact tracing.

	Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to evaluate a panel of statistical algorithms for temporal outbreak detection. Based on a large dataset of simulated weekly surveillance time series, we performed a systematic assessment of 21 statistical algorithms, 19 implemented in the R package surveillance and two other methods. We estimated false positive rate (FPR), probability of detection (POD), probability of detection during the first week, sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and F1-measure for each detection method. Then, to identify the factors associated with these performance measures, we ran multivariate Poisson regression models adjusted for the characteristics of the simulated time series (trend, seasonality, dispersion, outbreak sizes, etc.). The FPR ranged from 0.7% to 59.9% and the POD from 43.3% to 88.7%. Some methods had a very high specificity, up to 99.4%, but a low sensitivity. Methods with a high sensitivity (up to 79.5%) had a low specificity. All methods had a high negative predictive value, over 94%, while positive predictive values ranged from 6.5% to 68.4%. Multivariate Poisson regression models showed that performance measures were strongly influenced by the characteristics of time series. Past or current outbreak size and duration strongly influenced detection performances.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases. Although chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease receive more attention in developed countries, infectious diseases are the most important causes of suffering and mortality in developing countries. Recently, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is the etiological agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), has become an important sexually-transmitted disease throughout the world. Tuberculosis is again becoming a problem because drug-resistant strains have evolved. Understanding the transmission characteristics of infectious diseases in communities, regions and countries can lead to better approaches to decreasing the transmission of these diseases. Mathematical models are useful in building and testing theories, and in comparing, planning, implementing and evaluating various detection, prevention, therapy and control programs. See Hethcote and Van Ark [30] for a discussion of the purposes and limitations of epidemiological modeling.},

@article{BBSSZMCCkDomSNP2019,
	Abstract = {Background High-throughput sequencing technology has revolutionized both medical and biological research by generating exceedingly large numbers of genetic variants. The resulting datasets share a number of common characteristics that might lead to poor generalization capacity. Concerns include noise accumulated due to the large number of predictors, sparse information regarding the p≫n problem, and overfitting and model mis-identification resulting from spurious collinearity. Additionally, complex correlation patterns are present among variables. As a consequence, reliable variable selection techniques play a pivotal role in predictive analysis, generalization capability, and robustness in clustering, as well as interpretability of the derived models.   Methods and findings K-dominating set, a parameterized graph-theoretic generalization model, was used to model SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data as a similarity network and searched for representative SNP variables. In particular, each SNP was represented as a vertex in the graph, (dis)similarity measures such as correlation coefficients or pairwise linkage disequilibrium were estimated to describe the relationship between each pair of SNPs; a pair of vertices are adjacent, i.e. joined by an edge, if the pairwise similarity measure exceeds a user-specified threshold. A minimum k-dominating set in the SNP graph was then made as the smallest subset such that every SNP that is excluded from the subset has at least k neighbors in the selected ones. The strength of k-dominating set selection in identifying independent variables, and in culling representative variables that are highly correlated with others, was demonstrated by a simulated dataset. The advantages of k-dominating set variable selection were also illustrated in two applications: pedigree reconstruction using SNP profiles of 1,372 Douglas-fir trees, and species delineation for 226 grasshopper mouse samples. A C++ source code that implements SNP-SELECT and uses Gurobi optimization solver for the k-dominating set variable selection is available (https://github.com/transgenomicsosu/SNP-SELECT).},

The problem has several variants: the paths may be vertex-disjoint or edge-disjoint, the lengths of the paths may be equal to K or bounded by K, the graph may be undirected or directed. It is shown that except for small values of K all the problems are NP-complete. Assuming P ≠ NP, for each problem, the largest value of K for which the problem is not NP-complete is found. Whenever a polynomial algorithm exists, an efficient algorithm is described.},

@article{Carvalho2017,
	Abstract = {Graph models have long been used in social network analysis and other social and natural sciences to render the analysis of complex systems easier. In applied studies, to understand the behaviour of social networks and the interactions that command that behaviour, it is often necessary to identify sets of elements which form cohesive groups, i.e., groups of actors that are strongly interrelated. The clique concept is a suitable representation for groups of actors that are all directly related pair-wise. However, many social relationships are established not only face-to-face but also through intermediaries, and the clique concept misses all the latter. To deal with these cases, it is necessary to adopt approaches that relax the clique concept. In this paper we introduce a new clique relaxation---the triangle k-club---and its associated maximization problem---the maximum triangle k-club problem. We propose integer programming formulations for the problem, stated in different variable spaces, and derive valid inequalities to strengthen their linear programming relaxations.

@article{Wang2017,
	Abstract = {In many network applications, one searches for a connected subset of vertices that exhibits other desirable properties. To this end, this paper studies the connected subgraph polytope of a graph, which is the convex hull of subsets of vertices that induce a connected subgraph. Much of our work is devoted to the study of two nontrivial classes of valid inequalities. The first are the a, b-separator inequalities, which have been successfully used to enforce connectivity in previous computational studies. The second are the indegree inequalities, which have previously been shown to induce all nontrivial facets for trees. We determine the precise conditions under which these inequalities induce facets and when each class fully describes the connected subgraph polytope. Both classes of inequalities can be separated in polynomial time and admit compact extended formulations. However, while the a, b-separator inequalities can be lifted in linear time, it is NP-hard to lift the indegree inequalities.},

@article{Carvajal2013connectivity,
	Abstract = { Connectivity requirements are a common component of forest planning models, with important examples arising in wildlife habitat protection. In harvest scheduling models, one way of addressing preservation concerns consists of requiring that large contiguous patches of mature forest are maintained. In the context of nature reserve design, it is common practice to select a connected region of forest, as a reserve, in such a way as to maximize the number of species and habitats protected. Although a number of integer programming formulations have been proposed for these forest planning problems, most are impractical in that they fail to solve reasonably sized scheduling instances. We present a new integer programming methodology and test an implementation of it on five medium-sized forest instances publicly available in the Forest Management Optimization Site repository. Our approach allows us to obtain near-optimal solutions for multiple time-period instances in fewer than four hours. },

@article{Buchanan2015CDS,
	Abstract = { This paper considers the minimum k-connected d-dominating set problem, which is a fault-tolerant generalization of the minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) problem. Three integer programming formulations based on vertex cuts are proposed (depending on whether d < k, d = k, or d > k) and their integer hulls are studied. The separation problem for the vertex-cut inequalities is a weighted vertex-connectivity problem and is polytime solvable, meaning that the LP relaxation can be solved in polytime despite having exponentially many constraints. A new class of valid inequalities---r-robust vertex-cut inequalities---is introduced and is shown to induce exponentially many facets. Finally, a lazy-constraint approach is shown to compare favorably with existing approaches for the MCDS problem (the case k = d = 1), and is in fact the fastest in literature for standard test instances. A key subroutine is an algorithm for finding an inclusion-wise minimal vertex cut in linear time. Computational results for (k, d) = (2,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) are provided as well. },

	Abstract = {We examine the problem of building or fortifying a network to defend against enemy attacks in various scenarios. In particular, we examine the case in which an enemy can destroy any portion of any arc that a designer constructs on the network, subject to some interdiction budget. This problem takes the form of a three-level, two-player game, in which the designer acts first to construct a network and transmit an initial set of flows through the network. The enemy acts next to destroy a set of constructed arcs in the designer's network, and the designer acts last to transmit a final set of flows in the network. Most studies of this nature assume that the enemy will act optimally; however, in real-world scenarios one cannot necessarily assume rationality on the part of the enemy. Hence, we prescribe optimal network design algorithms for three different profiles of enemy action: an enemy destroying arcs based on capacities, based on initial flows, or acting optimally to minimize our maximum profits obtained from transmitting flows.},

@article{Liu2018,
	Abstract = {We study the polyhedral structure of a generalization of a mixing set described by the intersection of two mixing sets with two shared continuous variables, where one continuous variable has a positive coefficient in one mixing set, and a negative coefficient in the other. Our developments are motivated from a key substructure of linear joint chance-constrained programs (CCPs) with random right hand sides from a finite probability space. The CCPs of interest immediately admit a mixed-integer programming reformulation. Nevertheless, such standard reformulations are difficult to solve at large-scale due to the weakness of their linear programming relaxations. In this paper, we initiate a systemic polyhedral study of such joint CCPs by explicitly analyzing the system obtained from simultaneously considering two linear constraints inside the chance constraint. We carry out our study on this particular intersection of two mixing sets under a nonnegativity assumption on data. Mixing inequalities are immediately applicable to our set, yet they are not sufficient. Therefore, we propose a new class of valid inequalities in addition to the mixing inequalities, and establish conditions under which these inequalities are facet defining. Moreover, under certain additional assumptions, we prove that these new valid inequalities along with the classical mixing inequalities are sufficient in terms of providing the closed convex hull description of our set. We also show that linear optimization over our set is polynomial-time, and we independently give a (high-order) polynomial-time separation algorithm for the new inequalities. We complement our theoretical results with a computational study on the strength of the proposed inequalities. Our preliminary computational experiments with a fast heuristic separation approach demonstrate that our proposed inequalities are practically effective as well.},

	Abstract = {The mixing set with a knapsack constraint arises in deterministic equivalent of chance-constrained programming problems with finite discrete distributions. We first consider the case that the chance-constrained program has equal probabilities for each scenario. We study the resulting mixing set with a cardinality constraint and propose facet-defining inequalities that subsume known explicit inequalities for this set. We extend these inequalities to obtain valid inequalities for the mixing set with a knapsack constraint. In addition, we propose a compact extended reformulation (with polynomial number of variables and constraints) that characterizes a linear programming equivalent of a single chance constraint with equal scenario probabilities. We introduce a blending procedure to find valid inequalities for intersection of multiple mixing sets. We propose a polynomial-size extended formulation for the intersection of multiple mixing sets with a knapsack constraint that is stronger than the original mixing formulation. We also give a compact extended linear program for the intersection of multiple mixing sets and a cardinality constraint for a special case. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inequalities in our computational experiments with probabilistic lot-sizing problems.},

	Abstract = {We examine a routing problem in which network arcs fail according to independent failure probabilities. The reliable h-path routing problem seeks to find a minimum-cost set of h ≥ 2 arc-independent paths from a common origin to a common destination, such that the probability that at least one path remains operational is sufficiently large. For the formulation in which variables are used to represent the amount of flow on each arc, the reliability constraint induces a nonconvex feasible region, even when the integer variable restrictions are relaxed. Prior arc-based models and algorithms tailored for the case in which h = 2 do not extend well to the general h-path problem. Thus, we propose two alternative integer programming formulations for the h-path problem in which the variables correspond to origin-destination paths. Accordingly, we develop two branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms for solving these new formulations, and provide computational results to demonstrate the efficiency of these algorithms.},

In this tutorial we discuss the roots of performance variability, we provide useful tips to recognize it, and we point out some severe misinterpretations that might be generated by not performing/analyzing benchmark results carefully. Finally, we report on the most recent attempts to gain from variability. },

As a rule of thumb, larger neighborhoods contain higher quality local optimal solutions compared to smaller neighborhoods. However, larger neighborhoods also typically require more time to search than smaller neighborhoods. A neighborhood search algorithm is not practical if the neighborhoods cannot be searched efficiently. Thus, a rapid search algorithm is needed to make efficient use of large neighborhoods.},

	Abstract = {The paper considers the problem of scheduling packets in wireless broadcast systems under uncertainty with the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints. In such systems, a server periodically transmits a stream of packets over a broadcast channel. The client that needs to access the data, tunes in to the channel and waits for the next packet. This allows one to serve a large number of clients in an efficient way and also keep clients' location secret. We formulate and solve two alternative stochastic optimization problems that minimize the transmission time subject to CVaR constraints. Our results indicate that it is possible to derive an analytical solution to the problems in certain cases of practical interest. We also propose a methodology to obtain numerical solutions for the general case.},

The well-established market risk measure, CVaR, which is commonly used by financial institutions for portfolio optimizations, is investigated. In contrast to previous works, we consider CVaR as the main objective in the optimization of hazardous material (hazmat) transportation network. In addition to CVaR minimization and route planning of a supply chain network, the time scheduling of hazmat shipments is imposed and considered in the present study. Pertaining to the general dynamic risk model, we analyzed several scenarios involving a variety of hazmats and time schedules with respect to optimal route selection and CVaR minimization. A solution algorithm is then proposed for solving the model, with verifications made using numerical examples and sensitivity analysis.},

While some LP computable risk measures may be viewed as approximations to the variance (e.g., the mean absolute deviation or the Gini's mean absolute difference), shortfall or quantile risk measures are recently gaining more popularity in various financial applications. In this paper we study LP solvable portfolio optimization models based on extensions of the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) measure. The models use multiple CVaR measures thus allowing for more detailed risk aversion modeling. We study both the theoretical properties of the models and their performance on real-life data.},

The CVaR norm is defined in two variations: scaled and non-scaled. The well-known                                                                           \$\$L\_\{1\}\$\$                                                                                    L                        1                                                                             and                                                                           \$\$L\_\{{\backslash}infty \}\$\$                                                                                    L                        ∞                                                                             norms are limiting cases of the new family of norms. The D-norm, used in robust optimization, is equivalent to the non-scaled CVaR norm. We present two relatively simple definitions of the CVaR norm: (i) as the average or the sum of some percentage of largest absolute values of components of vector; (ii) as an optimal solution of a CVaR minimization problem suggested by Rockafellar and Uryasev. CVaR norms are piece-wise linear functions on                                                                           \$\$\{{\backslash}mathbb \{R\}\}^\{n\}\$\$                                                                                                              R                                                n                                                                             and can be used in various applications where the Euclidean norm is typically used. To illustrate, in the computational experiments we consider the problem of projecting a point onto a polyhedral set. The CVaR norm allows formulating this problem as a convex or linear program for any level of conservativeness.},

	Abstract = {Given a graph G=(V,E), the independent set problem is that of finding a maximum-cardinality subset S of V such that no two vertices in S are adjacent. We introduce two fast local search routines for this problem. The first can determine in linear time whether a maximal solution can be improved by replacing a single vertex with two others. The second routine can determine in O(m$\Delta$) time (where $\Delta$ is the highest degree in the graph) whether there are two solution vertices than can be replaced by a set of three. We also present a more elaborate heuristic that successfully applies local search to find near-optimum solutions to a wide variety of instances. We test our algorithms on instances from the literature as well as on new ones proposed in this paper.},

	Abstract = {The authors consider the problem of organizing a set of
                  mobile, radio-equipped nodes into a connected network.
                  They require that a reliable structure be acquired and
                  maintained in the face of arbitrary topological changes
                  due to node motion and/or failure. They also require
                  that such a structure be achieved without the use of a
                  central controller. A self-starting, distributed
                  algorithm that establishes and maintains such a
                  connected architecture is proposed and developed. This
                  algorithm is especially suited to the needs of the HF
                  Intra-Task Force (ITF) communication network, which is

                  alternates construction phases and local search phases.
                  In the beginning, a construction method provides an
                  initial feasible solution, while at subsequent
                  construction steps a diversification approach is
                  adopted for exploiting information gathered along
                  previous iterations.
                  Two local searches are used: a pure descent search
                  and a tabu search.
                  As further improvement of their method, the
                  authors propose to implement the {GRASP} choosing
                  criterion that at random selects the next element among

                  and the multicast-capable routers are the internal nodes.
                  The problem studied in this paper consists of placing
                  multiple replicated servers within the multicast-capable
                  routers and to solve it, the authors propose a number of
                  heuristic algorithms, including a {GRASP}.
                  The greedy function is the router cost function, while
                  the local search phase uses a $k$-exchange neighborhood

                  in finding a network structure and a demand alloction

                  The construction phase of the proposed {GRASP} is

                  the matrix bandwidth minimization problem consists
                  in finding a permutation of the rows and columns
                  of $A$ that keeps the nonzero elements in a band
                  lying as close as possible to the main diagonal
                  of $A$.
                  The problem can be easily stated in terms of
                  graph optimization problem, considering a vertex
                  for each row and a vertex for each column and
                  connecting vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ through an edge
                  either if $a_{ij}\not= 0$ or $a_{ji}\not= 0$.
                  Then, the original problem is equivalent to the
                  problem of finding a labeling $f$ of the vertices
                  that minimizes the maximum difference between
                  labels of adjacent vertices.
                  The authors propose a {GRASP}, in which
                  the greedy choice favors vertices having a maximum
                  number of adjacent labeled vertices.
                  The local search phase is based on swap moves that
                  exchange labels of a pair of vertices.},

                  problem arising in the context of traffic assignment
                  in communication satellites. A geostationary communication
                  satellite has a number of spot beam antennas covering
                  geographically distributed areas. According to the slot
                  switching configuration on the on-board switch, the uplink
                  traffic received at the satellite has to be immediately sent
                  to ground areas through a set of transponders. The slot
                  switching configurations are determined through the solution
                  of a time slot assignment problem, which is equivalent to
                  the decomposition of a nonnegative traffic matrix into
                  the sum of a family of switching mode matrices.
                  A refinement of {GRASP}, called Reactive {GRASP},

                  Reactive {GRASP} self-adjusts the parameter value

	Abstract = {The dysregulation of the normal cell cycle underlies an enormous number of pathological conditions, including the neurodegenerative
  disorders, all cancers, and diabetes. In Cell Cycle Control and Dysregulation Protocols: Cyclins, Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, and Other Factors,
  expert laboratorians detail emerging methodologies for studying the cell cycle, its kinases, and kinase inhibitors. The authors focus on
  issues of gene expression in vivo and in vitro, the analysis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, protein degradation mediated by the
  proteosome, the analysis of the transformed cell phenotype, and innovative techniques to detect apoptosis. Many of the protocols are new, such
  as electron microsocopy to detect apoptosis and proteosome-mediated degradation, whereas others study the interactions between
  protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, each one
  offering step-by-step laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principle behind the technique, lists of the necessary equipment
  and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. State-of-the-art and highly practical, Cell Cycle Control and
  Dysregulation Protocols: Cyclins, Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, and Other Factors offers pathbreaking researchers powerful tools for probing the
  cell cycle regulation across a wide variety of pathologies.},
